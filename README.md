# NeiveBayes
A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model thatâ€™s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.:

Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive.

#### Continuous Value Data Generation
Generatation of 200 random values, distributed around 20. Plotting the histogram will generate a not linear distribution...



#### Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two continuous variables. Often, the objective is to predict the value of an output variable (or response) based on the value of an input (or predictor) variable.
