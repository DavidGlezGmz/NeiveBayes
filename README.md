# NeiveBayes
A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model thatâ€™s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.:

Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive.

### Use Case
A database is used with the registration of "height" and "weight" of 1000 people. The classification (supervised) is binary 0 or 1 depending on whether it is male or female.
